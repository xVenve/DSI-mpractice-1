Objective of the practice: using the knowledge learned in the example applications: APP01 and APP02, program an application for editing restaurant orders:

- Pressing the [+] button will add the chosen product to the order and automatically update the Total.
- Pressing any of the [-] buttons will remove the product from the product list and automatically update the Total.

## Deploy in GitHub Pages

There is no need to create the branch, it creates itself.

Once the repository is created with everything in GitHub.

```Angular
ng add angular-cli-ghpages
ng deploy --base-href=/<repositoryname>/
```
